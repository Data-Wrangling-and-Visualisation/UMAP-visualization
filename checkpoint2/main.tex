\section{Overview of Our Progress}

By the time of the second checkpoint, we have almost completed the plan of our project, specifically:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Algorithmic part:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Original \texttt{UMAP} algorithm \href{https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap}{GitHub repository} was used as a backbone
		      \item We modified the original implementation to enable streaming of intermediate embeddings for visualization of concrete steps
		      \item We implemented data preprocessing pipeline to filter user input date for better quality of visualization
	      \end{itemize}
	\item Backend:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item We implemented a \texttt{FastAPI} backend server that accepts user input data, performs data preprocessing, and applies the \texttt{UMAP} algorithm to it, returning the history of intermediate embeddings along with the final embedding

	      \end{itemize}
	\item Frontend:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item We created a \texttt{Express.js} frontend application
		      \item We added a single page with submission form where user can upload their data
		      \item We added frames for 2D (using \texttt{D3.js}) and 3D (using \texttt{Plotly.js}) visualizations
		      \item We added a slider to allow user to select the step of the algorithm to visualize
	      \end{itemize}
	\item Deployment:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Every of the services is wrapped in a \texttt{Docker} container
		      \item We provide \texttt{docker-compose} file to run the whole application
			  \item \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Note:}} We do not have a running deployment of the application since \texttt{UMAP} algorithm requires a lot of resources to run. We do not plan to deploy the application, it is intended to run locally only
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Next Steps}
Our project is almost done, but it still requires some polishing and end-to-end testing. We plan to try to run the whole application on different real-world datasets and fine-tune our application where necessary
